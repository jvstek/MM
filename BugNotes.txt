Todo list
Make panel changes smoother. 
proper use of different style game modes.  Make it more flexible.  Put it in prefixed file. (all game modes with game settings) ? 
(all the modusses in a array... so it is stil compareble...+ need to make game bar more flexible thing of a logic to assign hotkeys)  in other words implement custom(advanced)
Is doable.... 
Make a prettier sound serive
Consistent same style name giving. (other people like that)

Final 

bug notes
When mmpanel was set on visible false it doest resize anymore. 
Make height and width from frame dependeble on row count. (or organize it with more panels) 
When increasing the row the shapes come closer and closer together. 
If the program is open multiple times it gives problems with the score.
