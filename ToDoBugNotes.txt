Todo list aka my stories
Make panel changes better* 

 scoreboard labels Prettier.
 Redesign Gui. Selectors get there own panel and stuff

 Fixes in Scoreboard / saving game. So you dont need to reload ALL the information the whole time. 
proper use of different style game modes.  Make it more flexible.  Put it in prefixed file. (all game modes with game settings) ? 
(all the modusses in a array... so it is stil compareble...+ need to make game bar more flexible thing of a logic to assign hotkeys)  in other words implement custom(advanced)
Is doable.... 

Make a prettier sound service (give sound location in the constructor or something)

Make abstract for checkscore. 

fixbugs

add functionality

Create more classes for methodes that make there own function. (selection helper, next row /cheker,  game starters . 

Decide when it is needed to do that what is the limet on when you do it and when not to do it	

Consistently same style name giving. (other people like that stuf)   
Write full variabele names. (dont use short cuts even when it is obvious what the variable name is)

bug notes
When mmpanel was set on visible false it doest resize anymore. 
Make height and width from frame dependeble on row count when making a new game. (or organize it with more panels aka redesign gui) 
When increasing the row the shapes come closer and closer together. 
If the program is open multiple times it gives problems with the score.

impedements 
Time vs relevance
